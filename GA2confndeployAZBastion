# Use GitHub Actions to automate the configuration and deployment of Azure Bastion. You would typically create workflow files in your GitHub repository to define the steps for setting up and deploying Azure Bastion. These workflow files can include Azure CLI commands, Azure PowerShell scripts, or other tools to interact with Azure resources.
# Ensure that you have the necessary Azure credentials and secrets securely stored as GitHub Secrets, and then use them in your GitHub Actions workflow.
# Here's a simplified example of a GitHub Actions workflow for deploying Azure Bastion:

```yaml
name: Deploy Azure Bastion

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Azure CLI
      uses: azure/setup-azure-cli@v1
      with:
        azcliversion: 2.28.0

    - name: Login to Azure
      run: az login --service-principal -u ${{ secrets.AZURE_SP_APP_ID }} -p ${{ secrets.AZURE_SP_PASSWORD }} --tenant ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}

    - name: Deploy Azure Bastion
      run: |
        # Add your Azure Bastion deployment commands here
        # Example: az deployment group create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --template-file azure-bastion-template.json

    - name: Logout from Azure
      run: az logout
```

# Replace placeholders like `${{ secrets.AZURE_SP_APP_ID }}`, `${{ secrets.AZURE_SP_PASSWORD }}`, and `${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}` with your actual Azure service principal details.
# Create a JSON or YAML template (`azure-bastion-template.json`) specifying the Azure Bastion configuration, and adjust the deployment command accordingly.
# Remember to customize the workflow based on your specific requirements and Azure setup.
